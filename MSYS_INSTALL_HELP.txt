HOW I INSTALLED MSYS (which includes MinGW and works with SSDL).


1. Download the installer from msys2.org. Install it. Default settings are fine.

2. Set the system path to include these two lines:
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
C:\msys64\usr\bin
(above any other lines that may include any other Unix-emulators like Cygwin or old MinGW versions).

Now you can use the Windows command line when using MinGW.

3. As msys2.org says, run these commands at the command line:

pacman -Syu
pacman -Su
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

4. To install SDL2,use this command (from https://gist.github.com/thales17/fb2e4cff60890a51d9dddd4c6e832ad2):

pacman -S git mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_mixer mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf

MSys2 should now be set up to support MinGW and SSDL.

To build SSDL programs, enter
copy Makefile.msys Makefile
make

To run SSDL programs, enter
bash runw
