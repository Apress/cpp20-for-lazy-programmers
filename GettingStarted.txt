To create your own programs with SSDL, see the newWork folder.

========== Installation of SSDL =================================

SSDL is built into this repository. No installation is needed.

-========= Installation of SDL2 and other helper libraries===============

Visual Studio and MinGW: No installation is needed.

Unix: In C++20 for Lazy Programmers, see Chapter 1 and Appendix A.

Note to Unix users (but probably not those using Ubuntu, Fedora/RedHat, 
OpenSuSe, and Manjaro): if the test program says it can't find fonts, see 
external/SSDL/src/SSDL_display.cpp, look for the comment 
"If none of these font paths work..." and do what it says.

Note for Manjaro users: the implementation of Microsoft Core Fonts for 
the Web I used, via this command (YMMV):   pamac build ttf-ms-fonts
...puts capitalization in some but not all the filenames. This is 
inconsistent with other versions of Unix.  Rather than make a special 
library just for Manjaro (!), I renamed all used fonts, eliminating capital
letters -- especially
Arial.TTF   -> arial.ttf
Comic.TTF   -> comic.ttf
Georgiab.TTF-> georgiab.ttf
Timesbd.TTF -> timesbd.ttf
Verdana.TTF -> verdana.ttf

========== How to use example SSDL programs ====================

Microsoft Visual Studio:

Open SSDL_Project.sln in the chapter folder. If it asks do you want to retarget projects, or really load them, say OK.
Right-click the project you want to run and Debug > Start New Instance.


MinGW:

Go into the project folder; 
  copy Makefile.mingw to Makefile; 
  make
To run,      bash mingw
To debug, bash gdbw

Unix:

Go into the project folder; 
  copy Makefile.unix to Makefile; 
  make
To run,       ./runx
To debug,  ./dddx or ./gdbx.
