2021-01-26: MinGW-W64 has changed somewhat and installation is no longer easy as it was described in Chapter 1.

If you already have MinGW and it is working (some older versions may have a compiler that's too old for C++20), and you want to keep it, great.  If not, I recommend using MinGW through MSys. You'll need to install MSys and various helper libraries (SDL2). There is a walkthrough in this directory (MSYS_INSTALL_HELP.txt). Currently it works great, and changes are not likely to be significant for a while.

Contact me if you are having difficulty (see HOW_TO_CONTACT_AUTHOR.txt). 

Best, W Briggs
