2021-01-15: MinGW-W64 has changed somewhat and installation is no longer done (it seems) as described in Chapter 1. When I have better information on how to set it up for the needed tools (make and bash) I will post that here. Contact me if you are having difficulty (see HOW_TO_CONTACT_AUTHOR.txt). Best, W Briggs
